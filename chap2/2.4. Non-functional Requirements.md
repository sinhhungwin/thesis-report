In order for a system to operate in a consistent manner and meet the expectations of its end users, it is imperative that it satisfies not only its functional requirements, but also its non-functional requirements. Such non-functional requirements include aspects related to performance, usability, feasibility, and security, in addition to the business requirements of the system. Specifically, the system's user interface should be designed to facilitate ease-of-use, while also providing a high level of responsiveness when accessed online.

To ensure that users are able to effortlessly execute desired actions without encountering any difficulties, the user interface and user experience must be designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and easy-to-navigate. This can be achieved through the application of techniques such as the incorporation of animation effects and the utilization of the Flutter framework, which can help to reduce lag and delay and enhance the overall user experience. Moreover, any processes executed by the system must generate appropriate output, while any issues must be promptly addressed, with the user being duly informed of the situation.

Furthermore, security is a critical element of any system, and the protection of sensitive information must be ensured throughout the entire data transmission process. This can be accomplished through the use of encryption and encoding techniques for all critical data being transferred over the internet. In addition, users should be required to log into the application before accessing any features that require authorization, in order to maintain system integrity. Lastly, it is essential that databases are designed to be easily backed up and restored, to minimize the risk of data loss.
