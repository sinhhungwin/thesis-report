In order for a system to effectively fulfill its intended purpose and meet the expectations of its users, it is essential that it satisfies not only its functional requirements but also its non-functional requirements. These non-functional requirements encompass a range of aspects, including performance, usability, feasibility, and security, which must be given due consideration in the design and development of the system.

One key non-functional requirement is the usability of the system's user interface, which should be designed to enable users to effortlessly perform desired actions without encountering any difficulties. To achieve this, the user interface and experience should be designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and easy to navigate. Techniques such as animation effects and utilization of the Flutter framework can help enhance the user experience by reducing lag and delay.

Moreover, the system must be able to generate appropriate output for all processes executed and address any issues promptly while keeping the user informed. Security is another critical aspect, and the protection of sensitive information must be ensured throughout the data transmission process. This can be achieved through the application of encryption and encoding techniques for all critical data being transferred over the internet, and by requiring users to log into the application before accessing authorized features to maintain system integrity.

Finally, databases should be designed to allow for easy backup and restoration to minimize the risk of data loss. By considering these non-functional requirements, the system can operate in a consistent and efficient manner, ensuring that it meets the expectations of its users while achieving its intended purpose.

In conclusion, Chapter 2 provided a comprehensive overview of the requirements and functional specifications for the development of a mobile application for managing sports teams. The chapter began by outlining the context of the project, the problem statement, and the project objectives. This was followed by a detailed analysis of the functional and non-functional requirements, as well as an overview of the use case diagram for the system. The most important use cases were described in detail, including event flows, preconditions, and post-conditions. Finally, non-functional requirements such as performance, usability, security, and feasibility were discussed in depth. Overall, this chapter provides a solid foundation for the subsequent stages of the project, including design, development, and testing.
