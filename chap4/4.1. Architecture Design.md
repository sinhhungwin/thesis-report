# 4.1.1. System Architecture Design

System architecture design would be the client-server architecture. The client-server architecture is a model in which the client and the server are separate components of the system. The client is responsible for handling the user interface and user interaction, while the server is responsible for managing the application's data and business logic. This architecture design allows for scalability and flexibility in the development process, as the client and server can be developed independently of each other.

Flutter framework would be used to develop the client-side of the application. Flutter allows for the development of high-performance user interfaces for both iOS and Android platforms. The Firebase platform would be used to develop the server-side of the application. Firebase provides a suite of services for backend development, including database, authentication, and storage.

To implement the client-server architecture, the client-side of the application would communicate with the server-side using RESTful APIs. The client-side would send requests to the server for data, and the server would respond with the requested data. The server would also receive data from the client for storage and processing.

The client-server architecture would allow for a clear separation of responsibilities in the application development process. The client-side development team would focus on designing and implementing the user interface, while the server-side development team would focus on designing and implementing the application's business logic and data storage. This would allow for more efficient development and testing, as each team can work independently of the other.

In addition, the client-server architecture would allow for scalability of the application. As the application grows and the number of users increases, the server-side can be scaled to handle the increased load. The client-side can also be updated and improved without affecting the server-side.

# 4.1.2. MVVM Architecture

MVVM is a widely used design pattern in mobile application development that separates the application logic from the UI layer, making the code more modular, maintainable and testable. This architecture has three main components:

- Model: This component represents the data layer and includes data models, repository classes and services. In your case, this would be where you integrate Firebase for data storage and retrieval.

- View: This component represents the UI layer and is responsible for displaying the data to the user. In your case, the View would be implemented using Flutter widgets.

- ViewModel: This component acts as a bridge between the View and the Model. It contains the business logic of the application, handles user actions, and communicates with the Model to retrieve and update data. The ViewModel also notifies the View of any changes in the data, so it can update the UI accordingly.

In MVVM, the View and ViewModel are loosely coupled, which means they can be developed independently. This allows for more flexibility and easier maintenance of the codebase. Additionally, the ViewModel can be easily tested using unit tests, which helps ensure the correctness of the business logic.
