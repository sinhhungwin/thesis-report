In order to design and implement an effective system, it is essential to have a solid understanding of the underlying technology and theoretical concepts that are relevant to the problem domain. This chapter aims to provide a theoretical background and technologies that are being used to develop the system. By providing them, this chapter will help to establish a solid foundation for the subsequent chapters, which will focus on the design and implementation of the system.

# 3.1.1. Introduction

The concept of matching football clubs based on their strength points involves using an algorithm to calculate each team's strength based on factors such as win-loss record, goals scored, and opponent strength. This information is then used to match teams with opponents of similar skill levels, creating a more balanced and enjoyable playing experience for all involved.

# 3.1.2. Background on Matching Systems

Matching systems have become increasingly popular in various industries, including sports. The sports industry has been utilizing matching systems for a variety of purposes, such as player recruitment, talent identification, and team selection. In the case of football clubs, the matching system can be used to pair teams with similar skill levels, thus providing a more enjoyable and competitive experience for both sides.

There are various existing matching systems in sports, such as the Elo rating system used in chess, the FIFA World Rankings for national football teams, and the Power Ranking system used in American football. These systems use different algorithms to calculate rankings and match teams based on their skill levels.

One of the major benefits of using a matching system for football clubs is that it allows for fair and competitive matches. By matching teams with similar skill levels, both teams can enjoy a more challenging and exciting game. Additionally, a matching system can save time and effort in the process of finding suitable opponents. Instead of relying on manual searches or posting on social media platforms, teams can use the matching system to quickly find appropriate opponents based on their skill level.

Furthermore, a matching system can provide valuable insights into team performance and can be used to track progress and improvement over time. By keeping a record of match results and performance metrics, teams can identify their strengths and weaknesses, and make informed decisions to improve their game.

In summary, a matching system can provide many benefits for football clubs, including fair and competitive matches, time and effort savings in finding opponents, and valuable insights into team performance.

# 3.1.3. Strength Points Algorithms

There are various algorithms that can be used to calculate strength points for football clubs, including ELO, Glicko, TrueSkill, and Microsoft's Matchmaking Server.

The ELO rating system is one of the most widely used algorithms for calculating strength points. It was originally developed for chess, but has since been adapted for various other sports, including football. The ELO algorithm is based on the idea that the rating of a player or team should change depending on the outcome of their matches. If a team wins a match, their rating goes up, while if they lose, their rating goes down. The amount the rating changes depends on the difference in ratings between the two teams, with a greater change for a more unexpected result.

The Glicko algorithm is another popular rating system used in sports. Like ELO, it is a rating system that is designed to adjust a team's rating based on the outcome of their matches. However, the Glicko algorithm also takes into account the uncertainty of a team's rating, which can be particularly important for new or infrequently rated teams.

The TrueSkill algorithm is another rating system that was specifically designed for use in online gaming, but has since been adapted for use in sports. TrueSkill takes into account not just the outcome of a match, but also the individual performances of each player on the team. It is particularly useful for sports that have a high degree of individual skill, such as football.

Finally, Microsoft's Matchmaking Server is a proprietary algorithm that is used in the Xbox Live online gaming platform. It uses a combination of machine learning and player behavior data to match players with opponents who have a similar skill level and playstyle.

Each of these algorithms has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, ELO is relatively simple to implement and widely understood, but may not be ideal for sports where individual player skill is important. Glicko is more accurate than ELO, particularly for infrequently rated teams, but can be more difficult to implement. TrueSkill is particularly good for sports where individual skill is important, but can be complex to implement. Microsoft's Matchmaking Server is specifically designed for online gaming and may not be suitable for use in other contexts.

### 3.1.3.1. Elo rating system

The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players or teams in games such as chess, football, and other competitive sports. Developed by Arpad Elo in the 1960s, the system is based on a player's or team's win-loss record and the strength of their opponents.

The calculation of ELO rating involves the following steps:

1. Establish a baseline rating for each player or team at the start of the season or competition.

2. After each game, calculate the expected probability of winning for each player or team based on their current rating and the rating of their opponent. The probability of winning can be calculated using the following formula:

```
E = 1 / (1 + 10^((R2-R1)/400))
```

Where:
- E = Expected probability of winning for player/team 1
- R1 = Current rating of player/team 1
- R2 = Current rating of player/team 2

3. Determine the actual outcome of the game and update the player or team's rating accordingly. If the player or team wins the game, their rating will increase by a certain amount based on the difference between their actual and expected outcomes. Conversely, if the player or team loses the game, their rating will decrease by a certain amount.

4. Continue the process of calculating expected outcomes and updating ratings after each game or competition.

The ELO system has been widely used in various sports and games, and has been shown to provide a reliable and accurate way of ranking players and teams based on their performance over time. However, it has some limitations, such as the fact that it does not take into account other factors that may influence a game's outcome, such as injuries, weather conditions, or team strategy.

### 3.1.3.2. Glicko

Glicko is another algorithm used to calculate the skill level of players or teams in sports competitions, including football. It was developed by Mark Glickman in 1995 and is an improvement over the Elo rating system. The Glicko system takes into account the uncertainty of a player's or team's rating, which is useful when rating new or inactive players or teams. The Glicko system also updates ratings based on rating period goals, which are predetermined goals for the rating system to achieve during a specific period.

The Glicko rating system uses two parameters to calculate the rating of a player or team: the rating itself (R) and the rating deviation (RD), which represents the uncertainty of the rating. The system also uses a volatility parameter (vol) that represents how much a player or team's rating is expected to fluctuate over time. The formula for updating a player or team's rating is as follows:

1. Determine the player or team's rating and rating deviation for the current rating period.

2. Convert the RD to a rating scale that ranges from zero to one by dividing it by the RD of a hypothetical player or team with a rating of 1500. This ensures that the scale is consistent across all players or teams.

3. Calculate the expected outcome of the match, which is the probability of winning, drawing, or losing based on the difference in ratings between the two players or teams.

4. Calculate the actual outcome of the match, which is the score obtained by the player or team.

5. Update the player or team's rating and rating deviation based on the expected and actual outcomes of the match.

The formula for updating the rating is as follows:

```
R' = R + (vol / (RD^2 + G)) * sum(V(i) * (S(i) - E(i)))
```
Where:

- R' is the player or team's updated rating
- R is the player or team's current rating
- vol is the volatility parameter
- RD is the player or team's rating deviation
- G is a constant value that depends on the RD
- V(i) is the weight of the game played (higher for more recent games)
- S(i) is the outcome of the game (1 for a win, 0.5 for a draw, and 0 for a loss)
- E(i) is the expected outcome of the game

The formula for updating the rating deviation is as follows:

```
RD' = sqrt((vol^2 / g) + (1 / sum(V(i) * (q(i)^2 * E(i) * (1 - E(i))))))
```

Where:

- RD' is the player or team's updated rating deviation
- vol is the volatility parameter
- g is a constant value that depends on the RD
- V(i), S(i), and E(i) are the same as in the rating formula
- q(i) is the number of rating deviations the opponent is from the player or team

<!-- ### 3.1.3.3. TrueSkill 

TrueSkill is another widely-used algorithm for calculating player or team skill levels in games and sports. It was developed by Microsoft Research and is commonly used in online matchmaking systems for games like Halo, Gears of War, and others.

The TrueSkill algorithm is based on Bayesian inference, which is a statistical method that allows for the updating of probabilities based on new evidence. It takes into account both the player's or team's win-loss record and the uncertainty of that record, meaning that it is able to make more accurate predictions about the outcome of future matches.

The TrueSkill rating system is represented by two numbers: a mean (µ) and a standard deviation (σ). The mean represents the player or team's "true" skill level, while the standard deviation represents the level of uncertainty around that skill level.

The formula for updating a player's or team's TrueSkill rating after a match is as follows:

For player i, let µi and σi^2 be the mean and variance of their skill level prior to the match, and let Si be their performance in the match (0 for a loss, 0.5 for a draw, and 1 for a win).

Let µ' and σ'^2 be the updated mean and variance of the player's skill level after the match, and let c be a constant representing the amount of uncertainty to add to the player's skill level.

Then the formula for updating the player's skill level is:

```
 µ' = µi + (K/σi^2) * (Si - E)
 σ'^2 = 1 / (1/σi^2 + K/β^2)
 ```

Where K is a scaling factor representing the importance of the match, and β is a constant representing the amount of uncertainty in the prior skill distribution. The value of β is typically set to the average skill level of all players or teams in the system.

One of the main advantages of the TrueSkill algorithm is that it can take into account matches with multiple players or teams, and can handle both team and individual sports. It is also able to adjust ratings based on the skill levels of the opponents, making it more accurate than simpler rating systems like Elo.

However, one potential disadvantage of the TrueSkill algorithm is that it can be more computationally intensive than other algorithms, due to its reliance on Bayesian inference. This may make it less suitable for use in large-scale matchmaking systems, where performance and scalability are key considerations.

In summary, there are several different algorithms that can be used to calculate strength points for football clubs. The choice of algorithm will depend on a number of factors, including the specific needs of the system, the importance of individual player skill, and the level of complexity that the system can handle. -->

# 3.1.4. Theoretical Framework for Matching Football Clubs

The proposed framework for matching football clubs based on their strength points aims to improve upon the limitations of the current Vietnamese seven-a-side football environment. This framework will use an algorithm that calculates the strength points of each team based on their past performance in matches against other teams with known strength points. The algorithm will be designed to ensure that teams of similar strength are matched against each other, thereby reducing the likelihood of one-sided matches.

Previous research on matching systems for football clubs has shown that algorithms such as ELO, Glicko, and TrueSkill can be used to calculate strength points for teams. However, the literature has identified a gap in the application of these algorithms in the context of seven-a-side football. In addition, the proposed framework will not take into account individual performance since collecting such data is not feasible in the current environment.

The proposed framework will consist of the following steps:

1. When a team registers for the Futebol application, they will be required to enter their basic information, including team name.

2. The system will create a new team and assign them an initial strength point value of 1000.

3. When two teams are matched against each other for a match, the system will calculate the expected outcome of the match based on the difference in strength points between the two teams.

4. After the match is played, the system will update the strength points of the two teams based on the actual outcome of the match.

5. The system will continue to calculate the strength points of each team based on their performance in matches against other teams.

The proposed framework aims to address the gap in the literature on the use of matching systems for seven-a-side football by providing a practical and effective algorithm for matching teams based on their strength points. By reducing the likelihood of one-sided matches, the framework will help to create a more enjoyable and competitive environment for all teams.
