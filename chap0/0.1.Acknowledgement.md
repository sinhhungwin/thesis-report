# 0.1. Acknowledgement

I would like to sincerely thank my lecturer and supervisor – *Doctor Phi Le Nguyen* – renowned professor at School of Information Communication Technology, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, who instructed and assisted me to successfully conduct my graduation thesis. She gave me various instructions and suggestions in technical solutions, user experience and thesis content that facilitated the process a lot.

I am also very grateful to all the professors at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, especially the lecturers in the Information and Communications Technology institute for the invaluable knowledge, skills, wisdom as well as hands-on experiences in my *seven* academic years. I’m sure they will be useful and practical, both in my professional career *and* my personal life.
