# 0.2. Abstract

In Vietnam, seven-a-side football is a popular sport with a large number of participants. However, football teams encounter several issues such as difficulty in finding suitable partners, securing pitches, and availability of unoccupied fields and time slots. One of the most significant challenges for football teams is finding an appropriate opponent. The limited pool of opponents typically consists of acquaintances, leading to quick exhaustion of the options. Although some solutions have emerged, such as searching through football forums or relying on pitch owners, they still carry the risk of encountering level differences between the teams, resulting in one-sided and uninteresting games. Furthermore, these types of games rely on the self-consciousness of individuals, making it likely for violence to occur if opposing teams resort to tricks.

To address these issues, I propose an application that serves as a reputable and convenient intermediary for teams to find opponents who match their level, play fairly, and have fun on the court. The application enables users to post information about their teams and find suitable competitors based on previous match results. Currently, the application has undergone testing on Android phones. Going forward, I will continue to gather user feedback and improve the system accordingly.
