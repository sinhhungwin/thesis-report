# 0.2. Abstract

In Vietnam, the number of people playing seven-a-side football is huge. The reality is, there are many problems such as football teams having difficulty in finding the right partner, hiring the pitch, the pitch owner having unoccupied fields and time slots. One of the biggest problem for football team is searching for an opponent. This problem is due to the fact that the opponent pool mainly comes from acquaintances, which makes it quickly exhausted. Some solutions have appeared such as searching through football forums or via the pitch owner. But these solutions are still carrying risk as there may be a level difference between 2 teams that makes the game boring and one-sided. Worse yet, these type of games depends on people's self-consciousness. If encountering a team that accustomed to using tricks, violence is likely to occur.

I propose an application through which teams can find opponents that match their level, play fairly and have fun on the court. This application will act as a reputable and convenient intermediary to help link teams of the same level. The application allows users to post information to find competitors, use previous match results to find competitors that are suitable for them.

Currently, the application has been tested on Android phone. In the future, I will continue to listen to feedback from users and the system will be further developed.
