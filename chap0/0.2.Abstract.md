# 0.2. Abstract

Seven-a-side football is a widely popular sport in Vietnam, but teams often struggle to find suitable opponents, secure pitches, and unoccupied fields and time slots. The limited pool of opponents available usually comprises acquaintances, leading to quick exhaustion of options. Current solutions, such as searching football forums or relying on pitch owners, carry the risk of encountering level differences between teams, resulting in uninteresting and one-sided games. Moreover, such games depend on individuals' self-consciousness, increasing the likelihood of violence if opposing teams resort to tricks.

In response to the challenges that football teams face in Vietnam, the present study proposes a mobile application, "Futebol," as a solution to address the difficulties encountered when finding suitable and fair opponents. The proposed application aims to be a reputable intermediary for football teams, offering a convenient platform for them to find suitable and compatible opponents to play against. This application targets smartphone users as it is a device that is prevalent among the population, and provides a convenient and reliable means for users to access the system and find the ideal opponent to match their level and skill.

The Futebol application employs the Model-View-ViewModel architecture to separate user interface from application logic and data, thereby enhancing testability, maintainability, and scalability of the system. Firebase is chosen as the backend infrastructure because of its scalability and provision of real-time database, authentication, hosting, storage, and analytics services. Data is stored in Firebase Storage and Firestore, while the frontend is developed using Flutter and Dart.

The application provides several features to manage user data and find suitable competitors based on previous match results. Users can rate others, which helps to eliminate uncivilized teams, and can communicate via chat to ensure smooth communication. The "Futebol" application has been tested on Android phones, and user feedback has been gathered to improve the system further. Going forward, the study aims to collect more user feedback to enhance the application's functionality and expand it to other platforms. By doing so, the "Futebol" application will provide football teams with an efficient and reliable means of finding compatible opponents, thus contributing to the development of the sport in Vietnam.
