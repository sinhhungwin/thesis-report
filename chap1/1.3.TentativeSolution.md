In order to address the limitations and problems identified in the previous sections, this graduation thesis proposes the development of a mobile application named "Futebol". The use of mobile applications has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially in the sports industry, due to their convenience, accessibility, and ubiquity. With the widespread adoption of smartphones, developing a mobile app is a logical solution to facilitate the process of finding suitable and civilized football opponents.

The proposed Futebol system is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, which separates the user interface (View) from the application logic (ViewModel) and data (Model). This architecture enhances the testability, maintainability, and scalability of the system, which are important criteria for a successful software project.

To support the Futebol system, the backend infrastructure is selected as Firebase, a popular and scalable platform for mobile and web development. Firebase provides various services and features, such as real-time database, authentication, hosting, storage, and analytics, which are essential for building a modern and reliable application.

The data of the Futebol system is stored in Firebase Storage and Firestore, which are cloud-based storage solutions for various types of data, such as images, videos, documents, and structured data. Firebase Storage enables the secure and efficient storage and retrieval of large files, such as profile pictures, team logos, and match videos, while Firebase Firestore provides a flexible and scalable NoSQL database for storing and querying data, such as user profiles, team information, and match results.

The frontend of the Futebol system is developed using Flutter and Dart, a popular and open-source UI framework that allows developers to build high-quality, responsive, and customizable mobile apps for iOS and Android. Flutter's rich set of widgets, hot reload feature, and reactive programming model enable developers to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface with less code and faster iteration.

In summary, the proposed Futebol system is a mobile application that leverages the MVVM architecture, Firebase backend, and Flutter frontend to provide a convenient, reliable, and engaging platform for football managers to find suitable and civilized opponents, rate their competitors, and enjoy intense and exciting matches.
