The goal of the project is to build a system that helps football managers find a suitable and civilized opponent in a favorable way. The system is named Futebol. The system presents the user with a list of the most suitable opponents for them based on their history, rating and location, one by one. Users can select opponents based on the system's suggestions, message them and add match results. In addition, users can also rate their competitors based on their competitive attitude.
