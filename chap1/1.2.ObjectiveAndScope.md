The main objective of this graduation thesis is to design and develop a system, named "Futebol", that addresses the limitations and challenges faced by football teams in the current Vietnamese seven-a-side football environment. As described in the previous section, teams currently rely on manual and time-consuming processes to find suitable opponents and arrange matches. Moreover, issues related to fair play, civility, and skill level matching can further hinder the overall experience of playing football.

To tackle these issues, the Futebol system will provide a platform that simplifies and streamlines the process of finding and selecting opponents. Based on a team's location, history, and rating, the system will suggest a list of suitable opponents that meet their preferences and requirements. Users will be able to send messages to potential opponents and add match results, which will allow the system to continually improve its recommendations over time. Additionally, the system will enable users to rate their competitors based on their sportsmanship and overall playing experience, which will encourage fair play and civility among all members.

The scope of this thesis will encompass the design, development, and evaluation of the Futebol system. The design phase will involve creating a detailed system architecture, data schema, and user interface. The development phase will involve implementing the system using modern app development technologies and frameworks. The evaluation phase will involve testing the system's functionality, usability, and performance, as well as collecting user feedback and analyzing the results. Additionally, the thesis will also cover related topics such as recommendation algorithms.

The Futebol system has the potential to significantly improve the football playing experience for teams in Vietnam by providing a modern and user-friendly platform that addresses the main challenges and limitations faced by players. Furthermore, the project will contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the fields of app development and recommendation systems.
