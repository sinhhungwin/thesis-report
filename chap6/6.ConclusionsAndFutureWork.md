# 6.1 Conclusions
Based on the identified problems in the Vietnamese seven-a-side football environment, this thesis aimed to design and develop a mobile application that addresses these issues. The application successfully provides a solution for convenient and easy finding of opponents, promoting fair play and civility among members, and finding matches that match the teams' technical expertise. The application's architecture and design were carefully considered, taking into account the limitations of the current system and utilizing modern technologies such as Flutter and Firebase. The successful development and implementation of the application demonstrate the potential for technology to improve and enhance the traditional methods of finding and playing football matches. Future work may focus on expanding the application's reach and promoting its use among the Vietnamese football community. 

Overall, the thesis provides a valuable contribution to the improvement of the Vietnamese seven-a-side football environment and the application of technology to address real-world problems.

# 6.2 Future work
